## Bob.io

### Overview

Bob.io is a realtime chat application with a chatbot that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to respond to the contextual polarity of the messages in the chatroom. This is a work in progress and is inspired by my Hackbright Final Project:  [Bob](https://github.com/LizzHale/Bot).
